This bug occurs when using the Expo `Constants.deviceId` API to obtain a unique device identifier.  In certain circumstances, particularly when the app is running in the Expo Go client on iOS devices, this API may return `null` or an inconsistent identifier, causing issues with user identification and tracking features. This is not consistent behavior across all devices and operating systems, making debugging particularly challenging.  The inconsistency likely stems from limitations within the Expo Go client's implementation of the API or from underlying iOS restrictions on accessing unique device identifiers.
